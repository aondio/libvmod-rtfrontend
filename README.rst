	Visiting "/html" you can get access to several different counters.

        ::

                rtfrontend.html();

INSTALLATION
============

The source tree is based on autotools to configure the building, and
does also have the necessary bits in place to do functional unit tests
using the ``varnishtest`` tool.

Building requires the Varnish header files and uses pkg-config to find
the necessary paths.

Usage::

 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure

If you have installed Varnish to a non-standard directory, call
``autogen.sh`` and ``configure`` with ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing to
the appropriate path. For rtfrontend, when varnishd configure was called
with ``--prefix=$PREFIX``, use

 PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PREFIX}/lib/pkgconfig
 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Make targets:

* make - builds the vmod.
* make install - installs your vmod.
* make check - runs the unit tests in ``src/tests/*.vtc``
* make distcheck - run check and prepare a tarball of the vmod.

In your VCL you could then use this vmod along the following lines::

        import rtfrontend;

        sub vcl_deliver {
                # This sets resp.http.hello to "Hello, World"
                set resp.http.hello = rtfrontend.hello("World");
        }

COMMON PROBLEMS
===============

* configure: error: Need varnish.m4 -- see README.rst

  Check if ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` has been set correctly before calling
  ``autogen.sh`` and ``configure``
